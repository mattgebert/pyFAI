Which one should I cite?
For the plain application of azimuthal averaging: JAC2015, for the calibration: JSR2020 and for advanced statistical analysis in azimuthal space: JAC2025.
In case of doubt, the latest paper should be fine.
There are already 1500 publications referring to pyFAI, some of them in the most
prestigious scientific journals (Nature, Science, PNAS, ...) and
44 other `applications <https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI/network/dependents?dependent_type=PACKAGE>`_
using pyFAI as a library.
